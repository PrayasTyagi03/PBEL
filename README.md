## üìò **Project Title**: AutoAI Model Building in IBM Watson Studio

### üîç **Project Description**

This project leverages **IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI** to automate the entire machine learning pipeline‚Äîfrom data preprocessing to model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. The objective is to streamline the creation of robust and scalable ML models with minimal manual intervention, using IBM's powerful cloud-based AI development platform.

The project uses **AutoAI**, an automated machine learning (AutoML) tool within Watson Studio, to:

* Ingest data
* Automatically clean and transform features
* Select appropriate algorithms (like XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.)
* Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like Hyperband
* Evaluate models and deploy the best performer to **Watson Machine Learning (WML)**

---

### üéØ **Project Objectives**

* Automate the end-to-end ML pipeline (ETL ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Deployment)
* Reduce the need for manual data science expertise
* Quickly generate multiple high-performing ML pipelines
* Deploy the best model using a secure, cloud-hosted API
* Provide a user interface (e.g., Streamlit) to interact with the model

---

### üõ† **Tools & Technologies**

* **IBM Watson Studio** (AutoAI module)
* **IBM Cloud Object Storage** (for dataset upload)
* **Watson Machine Learning (WML)** (for deployment)
* **Python & Streamlit** (for frontend integration)
* **IBM API Key & IAM Token** (for secure authentication)

---

### üß± **Project Workflow**

1. **Upload Dataset** to IBM Cloud Object Storage
2. **Create AutoAI Experiment** in Watson Studio
3. **Configure Target Column** and Evaluation Metric
4. **AutoAI Runs Pipelines** with:

   * Automatic feature engineering
   * Model selection (e.g., LGBM, ExtraTrees, etc.)
   * Hyperparameter optimization
5. **Leaderboard Ranking** of pipelines based on model metrics
6. **Select & Deploy Model** to WML instance
7. **Generate API Endpoint** for real-time inference
8. **Integrate with Streamlit UI** for easy input/output access

---

### üìä **Output**

* Trained and deployed ML model with REST API
* Leaderboard of Auto-generated pipelines
* Performance metrics (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score, etc.)
* Interactive Streamlit app to test predictions

---

### üîí **Security & Access**

* Uses IBM IAM (Identity & Access Management) for API key/token-based access
* Can be integrated with API Gateways for additional security layers
* Role-based access control within Watson Studio for team collaboration

---

### üîÆ **Future Scope**

* Add feedback loop for continuous model improvement
* Integrate with CI/CD for MLOps pipeline
* Expand dataset with external sources via Watson DataStage
* Use Explainable AI (XAI) tools like SHAP/LIME within Streamlit
